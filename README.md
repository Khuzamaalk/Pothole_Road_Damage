# Pothole_Road_Damage

Potholes pose a major challenge to road infrastructure resulting in vehicle damage and accidents. There is an urgent need for an automated solution that can accurately identify and segment potholes in real-time.

To address the problem we implemented the **YOLO8** object detection algorithm for real-time segmentation of potholes.
